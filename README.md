This project is a school assignment aimed at exploring Netflix data using the powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities of R Studio.

By leveraging various tools and techniques such as group_by, summarise, mean, ggplot, filter, mutate, replace_all, and remove_all, we delve into the dataset to uncover valuable insights about user preferences and content performance. Through data filtering and analysis, we identify interesting trends, patterns, and statistical measures within the Netflix data.

To enhance the presentation and understanding of the findings, captivating visualizations are created using the popular ggplot package. These visual representations provide a clear and intuitive way to interpret and communicate the discovered insights.
